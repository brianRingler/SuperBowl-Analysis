# Web Data Collection List of Super Bowl Winners & Losers
***
In this quick project, I wanted to use Python, JavaScript and VBA to collect data from a table of all Super Bowl winners & losers, from Wikipedia.  In this jupyter lab,  Pyhton will be utilized with a few imports.

Additionally, with this project the IDE being used is `Jupyter Lab` which has recently been released as an extension/improvement of the classic Jupyter Notebook.  What are notbooks?  Jupyter notebooks are documents that combine live runnable code with narrative text (Markdown), equations (LaTeX), images, interactive visualizations and other rich output. This particular cell is a markdown cell. You can do a lot with markdowns cells, [Details Here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_markdown_cells.htm)  If you want to learn more about this amazing IDE [check out jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/)

Also, take a few minutes and read this [article](https://medium.com/swlh/why-traders-and-finance-professionals-need-to-learn-python-97efc38d167) before moving on.
